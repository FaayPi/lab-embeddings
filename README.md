# Lab | Embeddings

## Introduction

In this lab, you will deepen your understanding of embeddings by applying them to practical tasks such as semantic similarity, clustering, and building a semantic search system. These exercises are designed to reinforce the concepts discussed in class and provide hands-on experience with pre-trained embedding models like Sentence Transformers. By the end of the lab, you'll have built functional tools that demonstrate the power of embeddings in solving real-world problems.

## Getting Started
